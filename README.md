# sportsreference
I will explain each of my code blocks below.
The first block I imported the needed modules.
Then I pasted the sample data into a dictionary to utilize it.
Then I created a dataframe from the dictionary and extracted nested dictionaries to get the team names and the losses they had against each other.
Then I pivoted the dataframe to format it as shown in the sample output.
